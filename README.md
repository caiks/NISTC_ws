# MNIST - handwritten digits workspace

This repository contains some examples of tests of the [NISTC repository](https://github.com/caiks/NISTC) which induces models from the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The NISTC repository depends on the [AlignmentRepaC repository](https://github.com/caiks/AlignmentRepaC). The AlignmentRepaC repository is a fast C++ implementation of some of the *practicable inducers* described in the paper *The Theory and Practice of Induction by Alignment* at https://greenlake.co.uk/.
